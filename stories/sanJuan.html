            <br>
            <p>SAN JUAN, P.R. --- Looming 145 feet above sea level, the impenetrable walls of San Juan’s San Cristóbal and San Felipe del Morro forts rise above Puerto Rico’s rocky Atlantic shoreline. Walking between the two, visitors can feel the history and imagine life nearly a half-millennium ago.</p>

            <p>The masons of the San Juan National Historic Site (SAJU) work up a sweat everyday keeping these historic walls in shape. In an architectural age of steel and glass, an appreciation for old-world construction can be difficult to find, but these men take pride in their role as craftsmen and as guardians of the historical and cultural heritage of San Juan.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <br>
            <p>The masons and the people with whom they work at the SAJU have some of the most interesting jobs in the National Park Service, a federal agency that employs not only park rangers, but thousands of skilled craftsmen, scientists, and others of diverse backgrounds and talents. The job descriptions of the masons, for example, involve as much history as they do concrete and brick.</p>

            <p>“Old San Juan is a place where a lot of people come from everywhere, so we want to keep the historic site looking nice for the visitors,” explained Miguel Vázquez, a National Park Service mason. “It’s our heritage. I want the people to leave with a good impression of our place.”</p>

            <p>Beyond mastering basic day-to-day maintenance techniques, these men have had to become experts in the technology of building preservation and restoration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3><em>“I love this part of the job,” Cole said referring to her work with the students. “I wish it could be my full time job.”</em></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>At 18-to-25 feet thick, the 3.4 miles of walls that connect the two forts and once encircled the entire colonial Spanish capital have stood for nearly 500 years, outlasting both siege and canon bombardment in five separate battles between 1595 and 1898.</p>

            <p>“Impressive isn’t it,” exclaimed Jose “Cheo” Bastian, a San Juan National Historic Site (SAJU) stone mason, about the walls, which stand about six stories high.</p>

            <p>“It’s hard to believe that originally the Spanish intended to build just one portion of the wall at sea level,” Bastian added. “When they understood that one level wasn’t enough to defend the whole area of San Juan, they continued to add on to the wall a little at a time until it was complete.”</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>A combination of the natural elements and modern influences has caused parts of the old structure to deteriorate and even fall apart. The dedicated masons are restoring the wall to be as close to the original as possible – using original techniques and materials.</p>

            <p>“We have modern masons that work in concrete and cement, but we select the best ones - the ones we know have real good techniques - to go through lime masonry workshop for about two years until they learn the materials,” explained Facility Manager Edwin Colón, who has spent 28 years working in construction.</p>

            <p>“It is completely different to work with lime mortars than cement-based mortars,” added Colon, referring to the ancient traditions the masons are following in the restoration work. “It’s been used for 5000 years, but since the early 1900’s we’ve lost the tradition of working with lime-based mortars because concrete is a lot easier and faster.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">

            <p>SAJU Mason Wilfredo Borges noted that the forts’ original walls still stand, but in the past the U.S. army put standard cement over dilapidated areas before understanding the complicated nature of the restoration process. This cement acted like a sealant and hurt the walls natural internal structure.</p>

            <p>According to Bastian, who has been a masonry worker for eight years and risen to the level of master mason, the limestone walls have a sponge-like quality, making it a material that needs to breath.</p>

            <p>“Lime relies a lot on moisture,” Bastian said. “If you put a layer of cement on the limestone walls, it will shut the walls down and inside will become a powder and the wall will die inside.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:30px;">

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Moreover, salt from the seawater gets inside the limestone; when it dries it becomes crystal. It oxidizes and expands. If sealed in by cement, it breaks the bricks.</p>

            <p>“The moisture that we let the wall get is just enough to let the wall breathe in and then go out, but if saltwater stays inside too long it will damage the wall,” added Bastian, shaking his head in disapproval at the army’s actions. “Cement and lime don’t mix.”</p>

            <p>As part of the park’s wall preservation process, Superintendent Walter Chavez points out that the park’s masons are currently working to remove all existing cement from the forts’ walls.</p>

            <p>“Wall preservation happens everyday because there is something to do here everyday,” Bastian said.</p>

            <p>Wild grasses, similar to ivy, cause additional problems. Bastian explained that the same winds that bring salt water from the ocean also carry seeds that get lodged in the walls.</p>

            <p>“Since lime is a material good for growth, the roots of these plants grow inside the wall, expand and break the wall apart just like the salt,” he said. “When you are walking around [the park] you will see it.”</p>

            <p>Yet, the problems caused by cement, salt and vegetation pale in comparison to the problems caused by the weight of heavy truck and automobile traffic. These modern intrusions caused a portion of the wall to buckle and collapse between forts San Cristóbal and El Morro more than a year ago.</p>

            <p>“The wall collapsed because it couldn’t support San Juan’s heavy traffic,” Borges said. “It was made for horses, not automobiles.”</p>

            <p>To do the repairs, the NPS masons are required to spend two years training in a laboratory where they study the 16th Century materials and building techniques. The park’s masonry team is currently re-facing the collapsed portion of the wall by using 16th century techniques and substituting the army’s cement covers with the a limestone binder combined with sand and brick dust to match the original walls.</p>

            <p>“We can’t go out and contract for preservation and masonry because many times it’s not done accurately,” said Walter Chavez the Superintendent of the SAJU. “But it takes at least two years to learn how to do the wall preservation properly. For a while we weren’t able to hire permanent staffers, so by the time most of these people were done training, it was time for them to move on to another project elsewhere.”</p>

            <p>Over the past three years however, the park was able to add seven permanent masonry workers to the staff. The program has been making great strides since then.</p>

            <p>“Edward Colón and his current preservation staff are fantastic at what they do,” Chavez said approvingly. “People around the island constantly commend us on work well done, as well as on our unique understanding of the limestone techniques we employ.”</p>

            <p>The strength of the preservation staff’s knowledge of 16th Century materials and techniques has become so recognized in their industry that masons such as Bastian and his co-worker, Ramón “Papo” de Jesús, have traveled to other locations to talk about their techniques. They have also been asked to host educational workshops to teach architects, fellow masons, and experts in preservation technology what they have learned through their training and research at the SAJU.</p>

They have also been asked to host educational workshops to teach architects, fellow masons, and experts in preservation technology what they have learned through their training and research at the SAJU.</p>

            <p>One weekend in November 2007 the NPS masons were hosting a workshop for the Association For Preservation Technology: Old World Technologies Adapting in the New World. The subject of their workshop was traditional lime and crushed brick mortars for restoration.</p>

            <p>At this workshop, Bastian and Colón taught participants about the lime-slaking process, pulverized brick preparation, and mortar application. It takes a thorough understanding of each of these steps to ensure the most cohesive assimilation of the original stones and the new bricks and mortars.</p>

            <p>“As masons we go out and get a sample from the area where the work needs to be done and then we have to make a replica as close as we can to that sample,” explained Bastian. “We know that if we maintain the same material, mortar, et cetera, the wall will receive it and it’s going to be like nothing happened there. It’s going to keep going the same way it has for 500 years.”</p>

            <p>Colón explained that after the sample has been examined and tested in the lab, the newly created replica goes through what is known as lime-slaking to make lime putty. This is the substance to which the sand and brick dust is added to make the mortar. Afterwards masons “beat the mix” to make it softer and softer for application.</p>

            <p>The “beating the mix” step is the only part of the restoration process that is not done completely with Old World technologies. De Jesús demonstrated how in the 16th Century mason would spend up to two weeks literally beating a mix of lime putty and aggregates by hand to make mortar. Today the masons in San Juan use two machines known as the crusher and the pulverizer, which mix the sand and limestone in under eight minutes to make up to 70 buckets of mix per day, but the masons create their application tools by hand much as masons did in the past.</p>

            <p>“But we teach the traditional way first,” Colón explained. “During their training, masons spend a week or 2 weeks beating the mix by hand. This way we know they’ll take care of the machinery, because they know if it breaks down they’re going back to doing it by hand.”</p>

            <p>“It takes a long time and a lot of effort,” de Jesús said.</p>
