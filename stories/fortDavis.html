            <br>
            <p>Park Ranger Tim McElwain brings history alive at the Fort Davis National Historic Site in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. </p>
            <p>Today, he is “cannonier” number five in a live demonstration of 19th century firepower. McElwain is part of an eight-man canon crew.</p>
            <p> In the nearby barracks two rifle racks hold about 16 old Spring Field single shot 45 caliber guns. Manufactured in 1873, American soldiers used the guns for their accuracy and range in fighting off attacks on settlers, wagon trains and stage coaches by nearby Native American tribes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <br>
            <p> Fort Davis became a U.S. National Historic Site in 1961 to preserve and commemorate this fort because it played a pivotal role not only in opening up the southwestern United States to settlement, but also in a special chapter in African-American history.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Army established in the Civil War all-black regiments of soldiers who fought for the Union. These segregated regiments became known as the Buffalo Soldiers, some of whom would later be stationed at Fort Davis, fighting various wars and skirmishes against the native tribes. The site consists of two dozen restored buildings and scores of ruins of other buildings. The site is more than just bricks and mortar, however. The site is a place where history is brought to life through reenactments by National Parks Service employees and history buffs.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Suddenly, the sergeant yells out McElwain’s number and that is his cue to deliver the ammunition to canonear number two, standing ready on the left side of the canon. Number two puts the gun powder into the barrel and then a third pushes it further with a long pole. There’s a brief pause and everyone takes a safe position. Spectators watch in anticipation, though there are no hostile enemies in sight. </p>
            <p>“ Fire!” yells the sergeant.</p>
            <p> A loud bang echoes off the Davis Mountains as a cloud of gray smoke rises above the men. “History is like going to a different country,” said McElwain of the living history demonstration taking place at Fort Davis National Historic Site.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>McElwain, a park ranger, has been interpreting and recounting the history of the Buffalo Soldiers and this fort since the summer of 2008. After graduating from Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Ohio with a bachelors of arts in sociology he moved to Fort Davis to work full time as one of the parks interpreters. He spent months studying the history of the fort and the soldiers by reading pension papers and letters.</p>
            <p>“You don’t learn about this in a history book,” McElwain said. “Before coming to Fort Davis I didn’t know the true story of the Buffalo Soldier.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">

            <p>Before working at Fort Davis he was recruited through the National Parks’ diversity recruitment program while in college. He worked two seasons at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, but said he found Fort Davis even more interesting because “there’s only so much you can say about caves.”</p>
            <p>After two seasons of interpreting, McElwain has created a program based on the bits and pieces of history of the men that once lived in the 26 bunk barracks of Fort Davis.</p>
            <p>While in character he carries a shaven pencil, a piece of paper and photograph of a loved one in his jacket pocket.</p>
            <p>“I go up to people and ask them to write a letter for me,” McElwain said. “Many African Americans were descendants of slaves back then. They couldn’t read or write so they would have someone else write a letter for them.”</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>In the officer barracks McElwain takes visitors back to 1867 when privates were paid just 13 dollars a month, slept on cots filled with hay and typically showered only once a week.</p>
            <p>
                “That was just a suggestion,” McElwain said to a crowd of about 30 visitors on his living history tour. “If these soldiers were to be in here today I don’t think they would notice any difference except it smells better,” he said.</p>
            <p>
                “Last summer when McElwain first tried on his garrison uniform he wasn’t sure if it would fit. The long johns under his wool uniform made it unbearable at first.</p>
            <p>
                “I got used to it and it’s second nature now,” McElwain said.</p>
