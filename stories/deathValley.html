			<h2>Death Valley National Park: Education that Rocks outside the classroom</h2>

				<p>Most teachers teach their lessons in a classroom limited by four walls. They use just a few books and perhaps a projector or computer.</p>

				<p>But at Death Valley National Park in California, Athena Cole, a young, Hispanic education specialist, has the sky, or the valley, at her disposal. The entire park is her classroom. The sky is her only limit.</p>

				<p>Cole works with other education specialists creating what she likes to call “kid-specific programs” for middle schools that she invites to come to Death Valley for field trips.</p>

				<p>The name of the project is Death Valley ROCKS (Recreational Outdoors Campaign for Kids through Study). Middle school students learn about geology, meteorology, biology and history in the park.</p>

				<p>“I love this part of the job,” Cole said referring to her work with the students. “I wish it could be my full time job.”</p>

				<p>Cole spends part of her job in the park working on developing the curriculum and taking the middle school kids throughout the park on their planned expeditions. The other part of her job is traveling to nearby cities to arrange field trips with schools such as Bailey Middle School – which in February 2008 became the first school to try out the new curriculum.</p>

				<p>The National Park Service actively seeks to bring public elementary and middle school kids to the outdoors where they can learn in an unconventional way.</p>

				<p>Typically, Death Valley targets fourth and fifth graders, but Nancy Hadlock, another education specialist, said that middle schools need the most attention. She said the highest drop-out rates are occurring in the seventh grade.</p>

				<p>“If you can’t reach them now, then you’ll never reach them,” Hadlock said. “Our society is not child-oriented despite what it claims.”</p>

				<p>Bailey Middle School, located in Las Vegas, resembles many urban schools.</p>

				<p>"The only lights you see are the street lights," explained Jessica, one of the students.</p>

				<p>To bring more schools like Bailey Middle to the park, Cole will live in Las Vegas and connect with local environmental educators.</p>

				<p>"Other parks have really strong education programs and ours is just getting off the ground," Cole said. "So, me being in Las Vegas makes it easier for me to go to a school or go to a certain area as opposed to somebody driving two and a half hours from Death Valley."</p>

				<p>Cole says she hopes that the kids will learn with Death Valley ROCKS when they do fun assignments such as looking for animal tracks in the sand or talking to a ranger one-on-one. Some of the kids also learn they have much in common with the rangers.</p>

				<p>Cole said her Mexican background helped with many students.</p>

				<p>"I found that a lot of people are surprised when I speak Spanish to them," Cole said. "And the kids come to me and speak Spanish to me because they probably feel a little more comfortable with somebody who speaks their language."</p>

				<p>One of the Bailey Middle School boys, Francisco, actually got excited to learn that Cole was also Mexican-American.</p>

				<p>"Sometimes when people make fun of me in school...they would try to make up words and stuff and they'd make fun of me and my friends," Francisco said. "When we were with my friends [in Death Valley], one of the rangers actually spoke Spanish to us."</p>

				<p>Cole knows the park welcomes ethnic diversity among both its visitors and employees - a goal the park director keeps in mind when hiring new education specialists.</p>

				<p>"Why should the Anglos have all the fun working in a national park and living in a national park?" Park Director J.T. Reynolds said. "There are many sorts of career fields that we have in the national parks. We even have secretaries, accountants, contracting officers, carpenters and plumbers. Anything you can find in the city, you can find it in a national park."</p>

				<p>So, what does it take to become an education interpretive ranger specialist?</p>

				<p>Hadlock says rangers have to be open-minded and they must love children. They need a college degree in education or a subject relevant to the ROCKS curriculum, preferably a master’s degree.</p>

				<p>Reynolds says it also helps to be adventurous and interested in protecting the earth, but much can be learned on the job, too.</p>

				<p>"You can learn to take care of yourself in an environment like this. We didn't all know how to hike," Reynolds said. "You have to learn those things and I think if a person has a spirit or desire for adventure, then working in national parks is a way to take care of that thirst."</p>

				<p>Cole herself did not know if she was cut out for the job. She had attained a bachelor's degree in history and was working for the National History Museum through a government program called the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP).</p>

				<p>When her husband got a law enforcement job at Death Valley, she followed him to the park in May of 2005, demonstrating what Reynolds calls Cole’s spirit of adventure.</p>

				<p>“The first time I went camping, I was scared,” Cole said adding that she really had no connection to nature, but now shares the mission of NPS. “My husband has changed my outlook on things.”</p>
