            <h2>Behind the Scenes with Yvonne Morales at the Channel Islands National Park</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Operating a visitor-friendly, clean, and safe national park is a complicated task that requires many different specialists with a broad range of training and experience.</p>

            <p>One of those specialists who often works behind the scenes is Yvonne Morales at the Channel Islands National Park in Southern California. She is a contract specialist and she helps hire the contractors who perform vital services and she also helps purchase the equipment and supplies the park needs every day.</p>

            <p>“You name it, I bought it,” said Morales, a 30-year-old, Mexican-American stationed just a boat ride away in Ventura, California.</p>

            <p>Park visitors might not often see her as they enjoy the building and sights of the Channel Islands, but they always see the results of her hard work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>For example, as the park's contract specialist, she recently contracted a company to renovate and build exhibits on an old Adobe ranch on Santa Cruz Island, one of the five islands.</p>

            <p>"It's been the vision of the park to build a facility out there, a visitor center so that when visitors get off the shore of the island, they have a place to learn the history of the island," Morales said. "To me doing that job out there is fulfilling because I know it's going to impact visitors and employees that get to go out there and enjoy and experience that visitor center."</p>

            <p>She enjoys seeing projects through to completion because it gives her a sense of fulfillment.</p>

            <p>"To know that you had a small part in making that dream come alive for people who had envisioned that, that's just a feeling you never forget," Morales said.</p>

        <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>Morales began working ten years ago at Channel Islands as an administrative assistant in the natural resources management department after studying business at a local college.</p>

            <p>"I thought, 'Ok, this is something different. I've never worked for a park,'" she recalled. "But I wanted to get some experience."</p>

            <p>What she found at the park was an embracing group of people and a worthwhile cause. She described her fellow employees as not only warm, but committed to the park and the visitors.</p>

            <p>"We're a very diverse park in that we have different people from all walks of life," Morales said, adding that she keeps in touch with co-workers from different departments in the park that she described as more of a community than a mere workplace.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">

            <p>"There's so many opportunities in the park," Morales said. "I mean we have jobs from boat captains to scuba divers, to biologists, administrative positions, and things like that. So, it's a really cool place to work."</p>

            <p>She said she enjoys the diversity of not only her co-workers and the visitors, but the resident wildlife as well.</p>

            <p>“We preserve that diversity,” she said with a touch of excitement and obvious commitment.</p>
