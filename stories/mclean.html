			<h2>Behind-the-scenes ranger assures all is well</h2>

				<p>Looking at his title and appearance, visitors might not think Sean Doyle is a National Park Ranger.</p>

				<p>“Most people are thinking of us as meeting with school kids, out on a trail, doing wildlife surveys, giving tours of the battlefield,” he said.</p>

				<p>But his is a job set more behind-the-scenes, working in concessions. It may not sound as exciting as working in law enforcement, but for him it offers the perfect balance.</p>

				<p>Some days he’s in the office doing paperwork, but others he’s out doing what he loves – walking different park venues in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>

				<p>“The office setting is more what my job is now, but my heart is in the parks,” he says. “The best part of the job is being able to come out to the parks and work with the folks on the ground.”</p>

				<aside>
				<em>“I love this part of the job,” Cole said referring to her work with the students. “I wish it could be my full time job.”</em>
				</aside>

				<p>He frequents the parks to see that everything is in order; from chatting with rangers to making sure a guardrail is structurally sound. Wearing civilian clothes, he mingles among visitors and learns about their experiences in an informal way because the uniform can sometimes be a little intimidating. </p>

				<p>When he strolls about he’s just another guy taking in the sights, sounds and smells of parks such as Great Falls in Virginia.</p>

				<p>“One of the things I really like to do is just come out to the park as a visitor and just join a tour, come through and see if by following signs I end up where I’m supposed to,” he says. “Eavesdrop with a group of visitors and [hear] just what they’re talking about.</p>

				<p>“What are the kids saying? Are the kids bored? Do people understand what this map they’re looking at is trying to tell them? And then I can go back and say I was hanging out with a family for 20 minutes and they weren’t understanding the point of this exhibit.”</p>

				<p>On a cool March afternoon, Doyle drives in and greets the ranger on duty at the gate. Surrounded by tall trees still naked from the winter’s cold, he navigates down the driveway and parks his car.</p>

				<p>Doyle casually walks over to check a cluster of signs that sit in front of a lightly wooded area, with the faint sound of the falls audible in the background.</p>

				<p>He makes sure the information has been updated and the signs haven’t faded in the sun. Simple things visitors never think about; that is, with Doyle and his fellow rangers on the job.</p>

				<p>During his time with NPS, he has come to better understand what his colleagues do, enabling him and everyone to better communicate and better do their jobs.</p>

				<p>“[Working in] fees gave me the opportunity to work across all the other divisions,” he says, "from law enforcement officers and administrators to historians to maintenance workers. You have the ability here to experience all of it. That’s another thing I wouldn’t trade.”</p>

				<p>Doyle first began with the parks service by giving tours at Ford’s Theater, working part-time during the summers. That eventually led him to year-round, full-time work.</p>

				<p>He left the Washington, D.C., area to work as a fee collector at Hale Acle National Park in Hawaii. But he came back to work at President’s Park, giving White House and doing special events.</p>

				<p>Then he went to Great Falls, again as a fee collector, but moved into administrative work and working with school group programs for kids.</p>

				<p>“This is probably the park where I started to realize the range of opportunities possible in the parks service,” he said about Great Falls.</p>

				<p>Next came an assignment at headquarters until he moved to the regional office, working there for the past 10 years in different capacities.</p>

				<p>“Occasionally people have told me that primarily my career has been in the Washington, D.C. area and maybe you haven’t worked in any real parks,” he said. “Even though geographically it may appear I haven’t moved around all that much, there’s just as much a range of parks here in Washington, D.C. area as service-wide.”</p>

				<p>But it’s not all about the location for Doyle.</p>

				<p>“The setting, to me, isn’t as important as helping people out at times, being goofy with people if it looked like they weren’t having the best time.”</p>
