            <br>
            <p>Miriam Spruill, Michelle Lewis and Judy Forte take a special interest in their work at the home of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. – a National Historic Site in Atlanta. </p>
            <p>civil rights leader and they want future generations to share the same pride they feel in the place and the life of the great man.</p>
            <p> Surrounded by a small crowd in front of a two-story, Dutch-style home at 501 Auburn Ave., Interpretation Park Guide, Miriam Spruill begins her tour through the home of King as a young adolescent, long before he became one of the most influential civil rights leader in history.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <br>
            <p> For the next 20 minutes she effortlessly fills the air with the details and a contemporary perspective on the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
            <p>The details light up the visitor’s faces. As a young man, King hated taking piano lessons. He once actually hurled himself out of the second-story window with a makeshift cape pretending to be Superman. Spruill humanizes the larger-than-life icon. Inside these walls, King is a child again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>“Everyone knows the adult version of Dr. King, but rarely recognizes that he was once a typical child,” Spruill said. “Our job is to show how his family and community positively molded him into the person he became later in life.”</h3>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>“Everyone knows the adult version of Dr. King, but rarely recognizes that he was once a typical child,” Spruill said. “Our job is to show how his family and community positively molded him into the person he became later in life.” </p>
            <p>With all the features of Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site, Spruill’s job for the past three years has grown. In addition to giving tours of King’s childhood home, she works in the exhibit area located in historic Fire station No. 6 (the first integrated fire station in Atlanta) and gives speeches at historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King co-pastored from 1960 to 1968 along side his father Martin Luther King Sr. and grandfather, A.D. Williams.</p>
            <p> At 20-years old Spruill has become an expert in all things concerning Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. As a Junior studying elementary education at Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina, she particularly enjoys working with the children who come to learn about Dr. King.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>“Because I am an elementary education major I mostly enjoy doing tours for the youth that visit our site,” Spruill said. “Dr. Martin Luther King was a smart child who graduated from high school at the age of fifteen and college at the age of nineteen. I emphasize this information to children on my tours as motivation for them to be leaders and to stay in school.”</p>
            <p>Working at Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site is not just a job for Spruill but a mission she cherishes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">

            <p>“As a young black woman I get a great sense of pride working here,” Spruill said. “I enjoy sharing Dr. King’s story with visitors from all over the world. My mission is for them to leave our site knowing new information about who Dr. King was and to be positively influenced and inspired.”</p>
            <p>The inspiring example set by Dr. King drew another trailblazer, Michelle Lewis, to the site of his home.</p>
            <p>When most people think of park rangers they imagine rugged men working in the wilderness, but park ranger Michelle Lewis is not a man and her park is not in the wilderness, but squarely in the middle of a bustling city: Atlanta.</p>

             <p>“There aren’t a lot of women, especially African-American women, working in law enforcement for the National Park Service,” said Michelle Lewis, law enforcement park ranger at Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. “This shortage has really created some new opportunities.”</p>
            <p>Lewis, 29, became involved with the National Park Service fresh out of high school. With the Park Service, she has worked a variety of jobs ranging from working with sea turtles and endangered birds at Cape Hatteras National Seashore to working in the interpretation department at Fort Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
            <p>“The Park Service really does provide an opportunity to get experience in just about whatever you want to do because the work is so varied,” Lewis said. “I was able to try some different things and do some work that I definitely wouldn’t have gotten to do otherwise.”</p>
            <p>
                While experiencing interesting occupations, Lewis also obtained her Bachelor’s degree in English and drama from Elizabeth City State University and then went on to earn a Masters in communication and filmmaking from Regent University in Virginia Beach.</p>
            <p>
                “It was nice working for the Park Service throughout college because I didn’t have to scramble around every summer to find a job and my schedule was very flexible,” she said.</p>

            <p>In 2005 Lewis began her job as a law enforcement park ranger at Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site and says the experience has been very special for her and her family.</p>

            <p>“My mom and dad are so excited that I work here,” Lewis said. “For the past 17 years they have put together the annual Martin Luther King program in the community I grew up in so as a kid I was always learning a lot about Dr. King.”</p>

            <p>Last January, Lewis was a keynote speaker at the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. birthday celebration, organized by her parents in Dare County, North Carolina.</p>

            <p>Lewis is still amazed at the breadth of Dr. King’s influence and legacy.</p>

            <p>“The hand of Dr. King reaches further than I ever imagined,” Lewis said, “You see people from all over the world come here to pay their respects to Dr. Martin Luther King…it’s a testament to, not only where we have been as a society, but where we are going.”</p>

            <p>Superintendent Judy Forte understands and shares the passion shown by both Lewis and Spruill for Dr. King and the site. Forte has worked at many of the nation’s most treasured locations in her 28-year-long career with the National Park Service and says Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site is one that she treasures in her heart.</p>

            <p>“I have worked at many parks that are all very significant and important, but this one is very special because it deals more with the spiritual realm,” Judy said. “This park represents the values I have as a person.”</p>

            <p>A 50-year-old native of Phoenix City, Alabama, Forte began working for the National Park Service during her junior year at the Tuskegee Institute. She became involved through the Park Service’s Cooperative Education Program, which provides students with jobs for the summer and then offers full-time positions after graduation.</p>

            <p>Forte accepted one of these positions in 1980, after receiving her Bachelor’s degree in physical education with an emphasis on parks and recreation. She worked at a long list of national parks including Appomattox Courthouse, Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site, Chattahoochee National Recreation Area and Horseshoe Bend National Military Park. Forte was even Chief Ranger of the Park Service’s south east regional office in Atlanta.</p>

            <p>“I liked the diversity of these parks I worked for,” Forte said. “I enjoyed what each of them offer and the story they have in American history.”</p>

            <p>Three years ago, Forte came to her position at Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. As superintendent she oversees almost every aspect of maintaining the site, including the administrative and management, interpretive and education, law enforcement and maintenance divisions.</p>

            <p>“I don’t look at what I do as work, but an opportunity to make a difference and have an impact on the preservation of our future,” said Forte, who loves educating those seeking the story of Dr. King and seeing the emotional impact of the Dr. King story on his admirers.</p>

            <p>“It makes me feel good to know the work I’m doing has a purpose, which is to impact other lives for the good, to make a difference and to educate our young people about the importance of justice, fairness and equality for all,” she said.</p>

            <p>“We have visitors come from all over the world that Dr. King has impacted. They boldly come in, many times with tears in their eyes saying, ‘I just want to be here’.”</p>
