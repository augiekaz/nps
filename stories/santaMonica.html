            <h2 class="text-center">Park Ranger Antonio Solorio Mixes Nature and The City</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The national park borders the bustling city of Los Angeles. The high peaks are just minutes away from the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean. Bobcats and mountain lion coexist with million-dollar mansions and the stars who reside in them.</p>

            <p>Park Ranger Antonio Solorio is a study in contrasts, too. Born in Mexico, he works for the United States’ National Park Service. Raised in the barrios of East Los Angeles, he was more familiar with concrete than canyons. Now a full-time student studying for his master’s degree, he also works full time at the park.</p>

            <p>Through Solorio’s perseverance and the park’s commitment to diversity and providing opportunities, he is a fixture in the park, where he teaches as many people as he can about this wilderness in L.A.’s backyard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <br>
            <p>Unlike large parks such as Yellowstone or Yosemite, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is a backyard park and actually a giant collection of municipal, state and national parks just north of downtown Los Angeles.</p>

            <p>The area even includes private land, such as shopping malls and movie-star mansions, all existing together under the umbrella of a “National Recreation Area.”</p>
            <p>Like many people in Los Angeles, Solorio didn’t always know about this park. When he moved from Mexico to East L.A. he was young and poor. His family wasn’t focused on providing him access to nature. They had more pressing problems.</p>

            <p>“Growing up a poor, working class city kid, I didn’t get much exposure to the outdoors,” recalled Solorio, as he walked along one of the park’s hiking paths. “My family’s priorities were to work to put food on the table and recreating or going outdoors wasn’t even a concern.”</p>


        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3><em>“I love this part of the job,” Cole said referring to her work with the students. “I wish it could be my full time job.”</em></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>A childhood spent in the city doesn’t exactly provide the standard career-track to working in a park, but with a little luck, a childhood crush and a teacher who cared, Antonio got his first taste of the great outdoors.</p>
        </div>
        <p>His high school had an Environmental Club that met at lunchtime to discuss ways to help the Earth. His motives for joining weren’t the most eco-friendly, but it was the message and the experience that created his desire for nature and made him stay.</p>

        <p>“I became involved with my high school environmental club, and it was me and a friend that got interested in experiencing something different in our daily lives,” he recalled fondly. “Part of it, too, was that that there was a cute girl in the club that I was interested in.”</p>

        <p>“We used to do beautification projects around our community, to improve our neighborhood environment, and then as an incentive, he would reward us with outings or camping trips into the Santa Monica Mountains or other areas remote from the urban center of L.A.”</p>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>McElwain, a park ranger, has been interpreting and recounting the history of the Buffalo Soldiers and this fort since the summer of 2008. After graduating from Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Ohio with a bachelors of arts in sociology he moved to Fort Davis to work full time as one of the parks interpreters. He spent months studying the history of the fort and the soldiers by reading pension papers and letters.</p>
            <p>“You don’t learn about this in a history book,” McElwain said. “Before coming to Fort Davis I didn’t know the true story of the Buffalo Soldier.”</p>
            <p>It was those inner-city experiences and the trips to the outside world that would affect Antonio for the rest of his life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>Instead of laying on his rooftop and just stargazing, he got to experience nature. Instead of planting flowers in a concrete jungle, he and his classmates got to get away from the honking horns of the city and enjoy the trees and mountains.</p>

            <p>After his first experience away from the big city, his interest in nature became insatiable. Antonio had found his calling in life, and his high school teacher once again stepped in to provide him an opportunity.</p>
            <p>“He said ‘You know, when I was younger, I was part of this group SCA, the Student Conservation Association. Let me write them up and see what they have going,’” Antonio recalled. “Fortuitously, that year [the SCA] had opened up a branch office in Downtown L.A.“</p>

            <p>With the help of the SCA and their Conservation Career Development Program, Antonio began attending meetings, learning about nature and how he could get involved. He would hop on his bike every Saturday and make the trek downtown to learn more about the environment, and score some free pizza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:30px;">

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">

            <p>That ultimately led to Antonio joining a group of recent high school graduates who traveled north to Yosemite National Park, volunteering to do work in the nation’s third-most visited park. Again, it was a life-changing experience for a teenager who was discovering and exploring the natural world.</p>
            <p>The time in Yosemite taught Antonio that there was a future in nature. Working alongside park rangers, he began to see possible career opportunities in the great outdoors.</p>

            <p>“We went to Yosemite National Park, and we were this derelict crew, out in the national park, being introduced to nature and the work done by these rangers,” Solorio said.</p>

            <p>The in-the-field experience led him to the classroom. After completing his bachelor’s degree at California State University in Los Angeles, he moved on to Cal State Northridge to get his masters in geography. But the goal ultimately was to get back into the wild. And again, the National Park Service would be there for him.</p>

            <p>Back at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, he’s working, teaching, and sharing everything he loves with the visitors to the park. While completing all the typical ranger tasks like guiding visitors and protecting wildlife, he also has time to focus on his specialty: ethnobotany.</p>

            <p>He gives tours showing off the park’s bounty of unique and useful plants, highlighting their benefits, medicinal and otherwise, and explaining how the park’s indigenous residents, the Chumash, used plants in their daily lives.</p>

            <p>He also uses programs like PAL (Parks as Laboratories) and EcoHelpers to get the children to replenish the plant systems and give children a sense of ownership in the park.</p>

            <p>While Antonio is currently finishing his degree, he’s also living his dream. He says he’s obviously not making as much money as the celebrities who share the Recreation Area, but he has achieved his life’s goal: working in nature and teaching other people about it – especially children.</p>

            <p>“I’m not going to get filthy rich, but that’s not my goal, that’s not my plan. I think I’m very rich inside, in having these places I get to go work at, a national park. There’s an endless sea of opportunities with the national parks. “</p>
