            <br>
            <p>Born in a small town just 30 minutes outside the south rim of the Grand Canyon, brothers Juan and Miguel Davila, ages 20 and 21, consider the park their home turf. They know it the way some know their own backyards.</p>

            <p>“Not everyone can experience America’s beauty. We’ve been here all our lives but sometimes we take it for granted,” said Juan Davila, explaining that his job in the park is never dull because when he shows visitors around the Grand Canyon it’s like seeing the sights “for the first time.”</p>

            <p>The brothers are a part of the National Park Services’ initiative known as SCEP (Student Career Experience Program). Currently fulltime students at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, they first joined the NPS as part of a different program, STEP (Student Temporary Employment Program) while attending Grand Canyon High School, which happens to be on the grounds on the national park.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <br>
            <p>The STEP program is design to introduce high school students to the opportunities within the NPS system to give them work experience through temporary summer jobs. Students typically apply for jobs related to their career interests.</p>

            <p>Pablo Garza, quarter’s maintenance supervisor, first hired Juan in 2003 and then a year later hired his older brother, Miguel. Garza has worked with good students before, but he raves about the Davila brothers and the responsibility they have shown over the years.</p>

            <p>“I don’t have to worry about them, I can give them any job and they take full responsibility for the job,” said Garza.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3><em>“STEP gives student workers a foot in the door for a government job,” said Juan. “A lot of federal employees are starting to retire, so they are looking for young people to fill those spots.”</em></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Juan first started working in the Grand Canyon in the summer of '03 when he learned that Garza, the supervisor, had an opening in his department.</p>

            <p>“He needed some extra hands on deck to move some shop supplies into the new facilities,” Juan said. “I heard it was a good opportunity to work for the park service, and because I had some friends who worked for the park service that said ‘go for it,’ I applied for the program.”</p>

            <p>Juan began working weekends and after school. By the summer he was working fulltime for NPS. The following year his older brother Miguel joined the team.</p>

            <p>The duo are a team on the job.</p>

            <p>“Working with my brother it makes things a lot easier, because we don’t have to tell each other what to do, like repeating steps, do this do that, and we get things done faster,” said Miguel. “We’re always on the same page.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>The Davila brothers aren’t always basking in the brisk air and the sunshine of Grand Canyon work days. They do have the normal sibling arguments that happen among brothers. “When we have arguments we carry our IPods jam out and ignore each other until the tension passes,” said Miguel.</p>
            <p>Tension or no tension the Davilas spend majority of their time doing what is called “quarter’s maintenance.” They restore two types of living facilities. One type of work is restoration of apartments used by residents, usually other NPS employees. The brothers paint, clean tile and fixed minor things.</p>

            <p>The other type is restoration of historical Grand Canyon housing and cabins and they really love this work.</p>

            <p>Any cabin or housing in the Grand Canyon built at least 50 years ago is considered historic. When restoring these buildings the brothers have to pay careful attention to maintaining the original look and feel of the cabin. Miguel said often they try to keep as much of the original fixtures, doors and widows as possible. They often remove lead paint and old heating and air conditioning units. At times the roofs need to be replaced as well.</p>

            <p>Last summer the brothers went to the north rim to restore historical cabins. The north rim is about a five-hour drive from the south rim. The Davila brothers, along with other members of the quarter’s maintenance crew, spent two weeks working on the north rim project.</p>

            <p>Before working at Fort Davis he was recruited through the National Parks’ diversity recruitment program while in college. He worked two seasons at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, but said he found Fort Davis even more interesting because “there’s only so much you can say about caves.”</p>
            <p>After two seasons of interpreting, McElwain has created a program based on the bits and pieces of history of the men that once lived in the 26 bunk barracks of Fort Davis.</p>
            <p>While in character he carries a shaven pencil, a piece of paper and photograph of a loved one in his jacket pocket.</p>
            <p>“I go up to people and ask them to write a letter for me,” McElwain said. “Many African Americans were descendants of slaves back then. They couldn’t read or write so they would have someone else write a letter for them.”</p>

            <p>In the officer barracks McElwain takes visitors back to 1867 when privates were paid just 13 dollars a month, slept on cots filled with hay and typically showered only once a week.</p>
            <p>
                “That was just a suggestion,” McElwain said to a crowd of about 30 visitors on his living history tour. “If these soldiers were to be in here today I don’t think they would notice any difference except it smells better,” he said.</p>
            <p>
                “Last summer when McElwain first tried on his garrison uniform he wasn’t sure if it would fit. The long johns under his wool uniform made it unbearable at first.</p>
            <p>
                “I got used to it and it’s second nature now,” McElwain said.</p>
