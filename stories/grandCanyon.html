            <br>
            <p>Born in a small town just 30 minutes outside the south rim of the Grand Canyon, brothers Juan and Miguel Davila, ages 20 and 21, consider the park their home turf. They know it the way some know their own backyards.</p>

            <p>“Not everyone can experience America’s beauty. We’ve been here all our lives but sometimes we take it for granted,” said Juan Davila, explaining that his job in the park is never dull because when he shows visitors around the Grand Canyon it’s like seeing the sights “for the first time.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-12">
           <!--  <br> -->
             <p>The brothers are a part of the National Park Services’ initiative known as SCEP (Student Career Experience Program). Currently fulltime students at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, they first joined the NPS as part of a different program, STEP (Student Temporary Employment Program) while attending Grand Canyon High School, which happens to be on the grounds on the national park.</p>

            <p>The STEP program is design to introduce high school students to the opportunities within the NPS system to give them work experience through temporary summer jobs. Students typically apply for jobs related to their career interests.</p>

            <p>Pablo Garza, quarter’s maintenance supervisor, first hired Juan in 2003 and then a year later hired his older brother, Miguel. Garza has worked with good students before, but he raves about the Davila brothers and the responsibility they have shown over the years.</p>

            <p>“I don’t have to worry about them, I can give them any job and they take full responsibility for the job,” said Garza.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3><em>“STEP gives student workers a foot in the door for a government job,” said Juan. “A lot of federal employees are starting to retire, so they are looking for young people to fill those spots.”</em></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Juan first started working in the Grand Canyon in the summer of '03 when he learned that Garza, the supervisor, had an opening in his department.</p>

            <p>“He needed some extra hands on deck to move some shop supplies into the new facilities,” Juan said. “I heard it was a good opportunity to work for the park service, and because I had some friends who worked for the park service that said ‘go for it,’ I applied for the program.”</p>

            <p>Juan began working weekends and after school. By the summer he was working fulltime for NPS. The following year his older brother Miguel joined the team.</p>

            <p>The duo are a team on the job.</p>

            <p>“Working with my brother it makes things a lot easier, because we don’t have to tell each other what to do, like repeating steps, do this do that, and we get things done faster,” said Miguel. “We’re always on the same page.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>The Davila brothers aren’t always basking in the brisk air and the sunshine of Grand Canyon work days. They do have the normal sibling arguments that happen among brothers. “When we have arguments we carry our IPods jam out and ignore each other until the tension passes,” said Miguel.</p>
            <p>Tension or no tension the Davilas spend majority of their time doing what is called “quarter’s maintenance.” They restore two types of living facilities. One type of work is restoration of apartments used by residents, usually other NPS employees. The brothers paint, clean tile and fixed minor things.</p>

            <p>The other type is restoration of historical Grand Canyon housing and cabins and they really love this work.</p>

            <p>Any cabin or housing in the Grand Canyon built at least 50 years ago is considered historic. When restoring these buildings the brothers have to pay careful attention to maintaining the original look and feel of the cabin. Miguel said often they try to keep as much of the original fixtures, doors and widows as possible. They often remove lead paint and old heating and air conditioning units. At times the roofs need to be replaced as well.</p>

            <p>Last summer the brothers went to the north rim to restore historical cabins. The north rim is about a five-hour drive from the south rim. The Davila brothers, along with other members of the quarter’s maintenance crew, spent two weeks working on the north rim project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">

            <p>Miguel especially looks forward to going down into the Grand Canyon to work on the historical cabin built within the crevasses of the Canyon.</p>
            <p>“We haven’t gotten the opportunity yet, but some of our coworkers got the opportunity to go into the canyon,” said Miguel.</p>
            <p>The cabins are now used for lodging for the park rangers and other workers, and as stopping-off points for hikers. To get to the cabins the staff must fly into the canyon using park service helicopters. “I am trying to convince my boss to let me go,” said Miguel.</p>
            <p>Miguel says restoration and maintenance are important to his career goals. Presently studying mechanical engineering at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Miguel wants “to be a chief of maintenance.” He knows those jobs generally require an engineering degree as well as experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:30px;">
            <img id="img-bottom" src="img/gcBottom.png">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Working in all levels of maintenance is important to Miguel: “I like to see bosses or people who have done the lower jobs and worked their way up because they know what’s going on,” explained Miguel, who sees the value of working at and understanding all levels of maintenance which teaches people what it really takes to do the job.</p>
            <p>Miguel also sees the work that he is doing now as part of his legacy.</p>
            <p>“I like seeing the finished product,” he said. “In the end, this is something I can say fifty years from now, when I’m a grandpa, that’s something that I did.”</p>
            <p>Maintenance work does not directly relate to Juan’s planned career in law enforcement as a park ranger. But the criminal justice major, who is also a student at NAU, has spent time with the park ranger staff and in the SCEP program he has shadowed the park rangers. Duties included keeping an eye on day hikers and assisting them while navigating the treacherous terrain of the canyon.</p>
            <p>Juan said that hikers often don’t realize how much physical effort it takes to hike the canyon. He said that going down into the canyon is not the problem but the time and strength it takes to hike back up the canyon can be overwhelming. Juan and the park rangers remind hikers to stay hydrated and remember those who hike down, must hike up, too.</p>
            <p>Admission to SCEP is offered to college students who have decided what field they want to pursue. Once in the program they may become eligible for permanent federal jobs once they graduate.</p>
            <p>“STEP gives student workers a foot in the door for a government job,” said Juan. “A lot of federal employees are starting to retire, so they are looking for young people to fill those spots.”</p>
            <p>Garza echoes that sentiment.</p>
            <p>“There is a huge shortage in government employment because they are retiring,” Garza said. “So we are looking to hire people in their late 20s to early 30s and if we don’t hire we are not going to have the next generation.”</p>
            <p>The brothers Davila advise students looking to join the NPS to research the environment and jobs – and know as much as possible about the desired job.</p>
            <p>“Apply to a job that you would like to do, because it is going to suck to work at somewhere you hate doing something, because you are going to be doing it all summer,” said Juan.</p>
             <p>These brothers don’t worry about getting bored with their work. While restoring a house or just taking a break, they can always just appreciate the sights. Just the other day they stopped to watch a passing herd of elk.</p>
